# vidgear-kivy-android-opencv
simple(yet works great) example of video+date transfer, from a python running server to an android client (tested on ubuntu too, but the other OSs are not tested)

first setup a running enviroment of buildozer
after making your first apk successfuly, take in this code and have fun
if have any problems with pyzmq and buildozer, feel free to see buildozer issue #1333
